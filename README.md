This is a modified version of the tic-tac-toe game, it is played with numbers instead of playing with X-O symbols.
every player has a valid set of numbers
one player has the odd numbers from 1 to 9
and the other one has the even numbers from 0 to 8

to win, you have to complete a straight line with values that add up to 15
